<h1>TLS HANDSHAKE ON WIRESHARK</h1>




<h2>Description</h2>
<b>I started wireshark and used the the incognitio tab from my browser to access google.com to ensure i make a new handshake as well as making sure no exists between the host machine and server.
</b>
<br />
<br />
I pinged google.com using the command line to obtain the google ip address so as to use it as a filter in wireshark.

<b>Wireshark displays all the information regarding the handshake including the message (Client Hello amd Server Hello), the protocol (TCP AND TLSV) etc.
